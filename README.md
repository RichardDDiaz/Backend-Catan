To register an user you must send a POST request to the http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/login/ endpoint
with the following json structure:

```json
{
	"user":"user_test",
	"pass":"Pass1234!"
}
```
This request will send you back the status_code = 200 in case you register correctly. Otherwise it will send you an error.

### Login User:

To login with an user that is already registered, you must send a POST request to the http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/login/ endpoint
with the same json structure specified in the Register User Scope.

This request will send you back the following json structure. Otherwise it will send you an error.
```json
{
	"token":"591b01910e1c574309efd78f52f8238f479db7c5"
